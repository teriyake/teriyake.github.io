What does it mean to plant something that has no weight? To tend to a garden that exists only through a screen?

This project emerges from an ongoing investigation into how digital technologies have become integrated into our sensory apparatus—not as external tools, but as prosthetic extensions that mediate our encounter with the world. Through an AR application that generates site-specific ambient soundscapes, I invite participants to become practitioners of a durational, embodied practice that oscillates between digital and physical realms.

The gesture is deceptively simple: using your phone’s sensors to gather environmental data, you plant a generative sound at a specific location. But this act of planting carries consequence. The sound persists, germinating and evolving as part of an emergent sonic ecosystem—one that other users will encounter, that will interact with other planted sounds according to acoustic and environmental principles beyond any single user’s control. To plant again, you must first listen. You must attend to the soundscape, distinguish the planted from the ambient, move through physical space to discover the source of another’s contribution.

This exchange—listening as prerequisite for creation—is inspired by Pauline Oliveros’ conception of “deep listening” and her understanding that composing involves attending to what is already present. But it also insists on a particular relationship to digital interface: one that resists the myth of frictionless, instantaneous interaction.

The interface demands physical effort, awkward postures, extended duration. It introduces lag where we expect immediacy, enforces gaps where we expect seamless flow. In these moments of friction, the mediation itself becomes visible, tactile, strange. The time between reaching out and receiving response becomes concrete, heavy, grounded—more akin to the temporality of physical relationships than the supposed weightlessness of virtual connection.

I am interested in what happens when digital interaction refuses absorption, when the screen both pulls and pushes the user toward and away from itself. In the repetition of this practice—planting, listening, moving, attending—participants may discover a productive dissonance: an awareness of how we navigate spaces that are always already mediated, bodies that extend through computational prosthetics, and ecologies that blur the boundary between digital and material worlds.

The user becomes artist. The practice becomes performance. And in the gap between virtual and physical, something else might emerge.
